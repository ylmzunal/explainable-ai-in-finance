# Explainable AI in Finance: Credit Scoring and Loan Approval

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques in the financial domain, specifically for credit scoring and loan approval. While traditional machine learning models can predict default risk with high accuracy, they often function as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand how decisions are made. This project implements XAI techniques to provide transparency in credit scoring models.

## Features
- Credit risk prediction using machine learning models
- Model explanations using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Local explanations for individual predictions using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)
- Interactive visualization dashboard for model interpretability
- Compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., Equal Credit Opportunity Act)

## XAI Techniques Implemented
1. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: Shows which features (e.g., income, credit history, debt-to-income ratio) contributed the most to a customer's credit score
2. **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)**: Provides local explanations for why a specific individual was rejected or approved for a loan

## Benefits
- Transparent decision-making process
- Regulatory compliance
- Enhanced customer trust through explainable decisions
- Identification of potential biases in the model
- Actionable insights for loan applicants
